# Crime-Reporting-and-Mapping

  ANDROID-BASED CRIME REPORTING AND MAPPING SYSTEM OF DAVAO ORIENTAL WITH GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) had been developed to increase the community awareness and improve the duties to the Police Department in terms of minimizing or preventing crime incidents in Davao Oriental.
  The system consists of two (2) modules namely: the administrator (Police) module and user (people) module. The problems in manual process of crime reporting had been analyzed and from that case this project had been made.
  In addition, the proponents gathered lots of information to identify the scope and objectives of the system. I utilized PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, MVC, JSON and JAVA in coding as well as the few software tools such as MySQL Query Browser as the data storage, Nox emulator and Android Studio.
  However, due to insufficient time, the proponents were able to formulate recommendation for further development of the system such as: the system should widen its scope enough to cater all regions in the Philippines; allow users to report using different media; and should be multilingual to increase userâ€™s satisfaction.
